The view component of the roads framework

For more information, check out examples/server.js. It goes through some details on how to use the component.
Very soon I will port over some documentation

Coding Standards:
If a object property is prefixed with an underscore (_) IGNORE IT. Changing it is not supported, and has not been considered in the development of the library.

If it is not prefixed with an underscore (_) and is not a function, you can change it however you see fit. Just read the documentation and understand the side effects of changing the variable.
